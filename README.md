# Man-in-the-middle attack on the TOR network


The material was done through surveys, before it was in my private gitlab and I also reported on some forums,
but I decided to put it in my github for all to see.

I am not liable for damages caused to third parties, the material is for academic purposes.

(The Tutorial is in Portuguese.)
